%{help=notes module}
###  help on the %bnotes modules%b
   This module provides the means for storing & retrieving notes
   at a later stage. 
   Commands:
      %bnotes%b%{+m}  %bfwd%b%{-}
   (use %b'.help notes'%b for more info)
%{+n}
   Tcl variables:
      %bnote-life%b  %bmax-notes%b  %ballow-fwd%b  %bnotefile%b
   (use %b'.help set <variable>'%b for more info)
%{help=fwd}%{+m}
###   %bfwd%b <handle> [desto]
   This allows you to set a note forwarding address for a user,
   this means if a note needs to be stored for the user, the
   bot will attempt to pass it on to the given user@bot, if
   the bot is not online then the note is still stored locally,
   if the other user doesn't exist, the note is lost. Boohoo.
