3. CTCP flood a bot, it ignores you, then channel flood, it won't kick
you. It should ignore CTCP and not ignore ALL (found by Plex/Harry).

note: there is no such thing as a CTCP ignore, will code this for
1.3.28. users.h - line 153, and detect_flood() in servmsg.c - line 283. <cybah>

--
4. +h flag seems to be redundant with .strip (confusing)

Status: SegFault is working on this

6.  There's been some discussion on eggdev about going back to the old way of
    doing the help files. I'll simply paste the Q & A from the list ;) <cybah>

Q. On 15 Apr, John wrote:
   > can anyone tell me why .bans, .-ban and .+ban are missing in .help?

A. its the new stupid way .help works hides lots of stuff
   in diffrent modules so you have to .help modulename module
   every f*cking module to see what commands there is.
   This is not userfriendly, we should consider moving back
   all commands to the main .help or fix a .help all command.

   dw

   Ok, we now have a concept but someone still needs to create a help entry
   for each module of the form: "<modulename> cmds". The entries should
   only contain the commands specific to their corresponding module. All
   entries will be shown when the dcc command ".help all" is called so keep
   the entries very brief.  -Fabian

7. ./configure not detecting static tcl being incompatible with modules in
    some situations (ask details to Tothwolf).

Status: noone is working on this

11. +shared/+s flags need to be recoded. The way all this works seems to be
confusing for users.

Status: noone is working on this

--
12. some users asked for mIrc bantypes (1/2/3/4) for the eggdrop. A setting
has to be added to allow the bot-owner to choose the banmask type he wants
his bot to use. not before 1.3.28.

<drummer> .kickban command already supports different bantypes...

14. fix the eggdrop/tcl8.* info exist bug.

Status: noone is working on this

15. rewrite the eggdrop server queue, like Cybah's bot. not before 1.3.28.

Status: Cybah ?

--
16. From the eggheads list: <cybah>

I think there is a minor bug in the way
how botnets restructure...

dcc!leafy *** Unlinked oldhub (restructure)
dcc!leafy [17:13] ERROR linking newhub: Already connected.
dcc!leafy [17:13] Lost bot: newhub

problem here is, that they delink from the old hub
and link to the newly designated (or alternate) hub
immediately, but that hub doesnt have the information
that leafy unlinked from newhub yet (botnet lag), so it will
say error: already connceted. making the bots wait
for about 2 seconds before re-linking would fix this

18.

There are some english sentences in the C src. They should be moved to
/language. We also need some coordination between the different
languages.

Status: slennox is working on this.
	Michael is working on updating the German lang file, can we pls
	have some updates for the other languages? <cybah>

21. We need a better solution to the non-rfc-complient networks than to remove
    -DRFC_COMPLIENT from the Makefile. Need to make rfc_casecmp a pointer to a
    function and check net-type whenever the config file is loaded. Obviously
    with this approach, net-type has to be set readonly because we cant check
    when it's value is changed on a running bot. Anyone who changes it
    on-the-fly is mad anyway :p If net-type is set on a known non rfc-complient
    network, we just point rfc_casecmp at strcasecmp.. otherwise to the proper
    functions <Cybah>

   bind time - "?5 * * * *" time:join:channel

49. Adds a tcl config setting to allow vs correct bogus-bans (suggested by
matt).

set bogus-bans [0/1] <- if set to 0, the bot won't do anything if people
set bogus bans thus preventing bogus ban floods. it will only react to
bogus bans if it is set to 1.
