Whats new, first read the following documents:
INSTALL
README
BOTNET
UPDATES1.4
MODULES
tcl-commands.doc


All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest
changes to eggdrop in version 1.4.xx -- This series is alot like
the 1.3.xx series, so this file may not be needed for you.

Alot of things have changed in this version so at a minimum read the
UPDATES1.4 and BOTNET text files.  UPDATES shows whats been added and
fixed along the way.  BOTNET gives a comprehensive step by step guide on
linking bots and the new bot flags.

CAUTION:
1.  Before you start the bot for the first time BACKUP your userfile if
this is an upgrade from a previous version.

2.  DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE!!  MAKE A NEW ONE.........

SHARING
Sharing has changed a little.  You will notice that a resync buffer is
kept for share bots when they disconnect.  This allows for them not to
have to send the entire userfile again when they reconnect.  This is a
much more effient approach to syncing the user files.

BOTFLAGS
Bot flags have changed. It is recommended that you read the BOTNET
document to learn more about linking bots.  Major changes in how you
configure a passive and aggressive bot.

USERFLAGS
User flags have changed.  You still have the basic flags but others have
been added.  Some changes to this are that if someone has a global +n they
will automatically be given all the global flags available.  You will also
notice there are no more capital letters; each flag has its own unique
letter.  An example is the B flag, in previous versions, it stood for a
botnet master.  The new flag is t.  For more information on these changes,
see the .help whois for a list of all flags. 1.3.24 introduces a new flag
for +stopnethack procedure flexibility: +w.

LANGUAGES
Almost everthing the bot says now is in language file.  This should allow
the bot to be more versatile for other people that do not speak english.
As soon as we start getting the translations in there will be a directory
on raistlin.toledolink.com that will contain ready to use language files.
Look for it real soon.

3.  MISC stuff

COMMANDS
.voice and .devoice commands where added in dcc chat.  This will
voice a user on a channel if the bot is oped.  Likewise for the .devoice
command.

.email is now support in userinfo1.0.tcl so if you want emails to work, use
this :)
