It's two AM on a Saturday
Beldin boots up and logs in
There's an old buglist sitting next to him
But he's going to leave them all in

I said Beldin can you make me a little bug
I'm not really sure what to hose
But it crashes and beeps and it gives me the creeps
'Cause Beldin your coding it blows

La la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Make us a bug, you're just Beldin man
Make us a bug tonight
Cause were all in the mood for a SIGSEGV
And you've got us crashing all right

Now Robey at Netscape's a friend of his
He fixes his bugs for free
And he's quick with a joke but his code it will choke
But there's some bugs that he doesn't see

He says "Raist I believe this is killing me"
As the coke sloshes down on his face
And the stains on his shirt are still sitting there
>From the coke and the squirtings with mace

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Make us a bug, you're just Beldin man
Make us a bug tonight
Cause were all in the mood for a SIGSEGV
And you've got us crashing all right

Now Beldin's a taxi cab driver
And he never could find a wife
And he's talkin' to Cfusion who's really confusin'
And he probably should get a life

And the coding team's practicing bugfixing
As beldin goes overdrive
Yes they're sharing a drink we call bugginess
Sort of like Win95

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Make us a bug, you're just Beldin man
Make us a bug tonight
Cause were all in the mood for a SIGSEGV
And you've got us crashing all right

It's a pretty big bug for a Saturday
For coding late at night
Cause he knows that the coding is not well aboding
When loading requires a fight

And the users are forming a lynch mob
At him they poke fun and they jeer
And they download the source and with no remorse 
Mod till the bugs dissappear

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Make us a bug, you're just Beldin man
Make us a bug tonight
Cause were all in the mood for a SIGSEGV
And you've got us crashing all right
