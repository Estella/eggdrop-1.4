<b><font color="#FF0000">News - Updated 08 Nov
1999</font></b>
<hr>
<p>Whats new, first read the following documents:
<blockquote><a href="install.html">INSTALL</a>
<br><a href="readme.html">README</a>
<br><a href="botnet.html">BOTNET</a>
<br>UPDATES1.4
<br><a href="app-tcl-commands.html">tcl-commands</a></blockquote>

<p><br>All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest changes
to eggdrop in version 1.4.xx -- This series is alot like the 1.3.xx series,
so this file may not be needed for you.
<p>Alot of things have changed in this version so at a minimum read the
UPDATES1.4 and <a href="botnet.html">BOTNET</a> text files. UPDATES shows
whats been added and fixed along the way. BOTNET gives a comprehensive
step by step guide on linking bots and the new bot flags.
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">CAUTION:</font></b>
<blockquote>1. Before you start the bot for the first time BACKUP your
userfile if this is an upgrade from a previous version.
<p>2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE.. MAKE A NEW ONE.........</blockquote>
<b><font color="#FF0000">SHARING</font></b>
<blockquote>Sharing has changed a little. You will notice that a resync
buffer is kept for share bots when they disconnect. This allows for them
not to have to send the entire userfile again when they reconnect. This
is a much more effient approach to syncing the user files.</blockquote>
<b><font color="#FF0000">BOTFLAGS</font></b>
<blockquote>Bot flags have changed. It is recommended that you read the
BOTNET document to learn more about linking bots. Major changes in how
you configure a passive and aggressive bot.</blockquote>
<b><font color="#FF0000">USERFLAGS</font></b>
<blockquote>User flags have changed. You still have the basic flags but
others have been added. Some changes to this are that if someone has a
global +n they will automatically be given all the global flags available.
You will also notice there are no more capital letters; each flag has its
own unique letter. An example is the B flag, in previous versions, it stood
for a botnet master. The new flag is t. For more information on these changes,
see the .help whois for a list of all flags. 1.3.24 introduces a new flag
for +stopnethack procedure flexibility: +w.</blockquote>
<b><font color="#FF0000">LANGUAGES</font></b>
<blockquote>Almost everthing the bot says now is in language file. This
should allow the bot to be more versatile for other people that do not
speak english. As soon as we start getting the translations in there will
be a directory on ftp.eggheads.org that will contain ready to use language
files. Look for it real soon.</blockquote>
<b><font color="#FF0000">COMMANDS</font></b>
<blockquote><i>.voice</i> and <i>.devoice</i> commands where added in dcc
chat. This will voice a user on a channel if the bot is oped. Likewise
for the .devoice command.
<br><i>.email</i> is now support in userinfo1.0.tcl so if you want emails
to work, use this :)</blockquote>
