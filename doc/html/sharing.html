SHARING</font></font></font></b>
<hr>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the more
interesting things you can do when you link two bots, is to make them share
userfiles. BE CAREFUL before you do this, though! When you link, one bot
is going to lose its userfile! (It will be overwritten by the other bot's
userfile.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>To do userfile sharing,
you have to make sure the share module and transfer modules are loaded.
Otherwise, your bot will automatically reject all userfile share attempts
by other bots. (It's a safety feature.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next you need to decide
which bot will be ACTIVE and which will be PASSIVE, the ACTIVE bot will
send its userfile and overwrite the PASSIVE's userfile, so be careful.
Once you've decided, on the ACTIVE bot, you set the PASSIVE bot +s, to
indicate sharing, and on the PASSIVE you set the ACTIVE +p to indicate
passive sharing, the bot will only share passively with 1 bot at once,
but can share actively with any number of bots.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Next go through all the
channels you want shared between the 2 bots and make sure they are +shared
in the config file, and also that each bot has the other bot make +s for
each channel,</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>e.g. on bot1:
.botattr bot2 |+s #channel</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>When two sharing bots first
connect, they will transfer the userfile. After that, when something in
the user records changes, the info will be passed to the other share bot(s)
so that as long as they are linked, they will stay in sync.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>By default, if two sharing
bots get disconnected, when they reconnect the userfile will be completely
transferred again. However, there is an option to use resync buffers. Resync
buffers work by when the two sharing bots get disconnected, they start
up resync buffers for each other. If they are reconnected within 15 minutes
<i>(default)</i>, they can resync from the buffers they have held, and
not have to re-download the userfile.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>*WARNING* - The resync
option may not work reliably.</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can mark a bot both
+s and +a (share user files, but only link as an alternate). This is very
odd and should probably only be used as a backup when you have a lot of
bots sharing to one central hub. Only people who really know what they're
doing should try marking a bot +s and +a.</font></font></blockquote>
