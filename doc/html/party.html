PARTY LINE</font></font></font></b>
<hr>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The most important
way you will communicate with your bot is through the party line. The party
line is accessible via DCC chat or telnet. It's pretty much just a miniature
lagless irc (see "Botnet" below), but it also consists of a console through
which you can watch channel activity and give commands.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>To enter the party line,
just offer a DCC chat to your bot. It should ask for your password if you've
set one. If you haven't set one, be sure to do so, so that you can use
the /msg "ident" command and other goodies that require some sort of security.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The party line is actually
split up into 200,000 "channels". The console is available from each channel,
but you can only talk to people who are on your current channel (just like
irc). Channel 0 is the main party line, while others are typically reserved
for private conversations. Channels 1-99,999 are botnet wide chat channels
and any user joining that channel anywhere on the botnet will be able to
chat with you, Channels *0-*99,999 are local bot-only channels, only people
on the current bot you are on can chat to you on there channels.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Commands for the console
start with a dot (.), similar to the slash (/) used for irc. At any time
you can type <i>".help"</i> to get a list of the possible commands. To
find out what a command does, use <i>".help &lt;command>"</i> -- for example,
<i>".help
channel"</i>. This documentation's appendix has the on-line help files
for you to browse at your leisure.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>When you're on the party
line, anything you type that doesn't start with a dot is considered to
be broadcast to everyone else, just like talking on a channel. You can
change channels with the <i>".chat"</i> command or even leave all channels
with <i>".chat off".</i></font></font></blockquote>
