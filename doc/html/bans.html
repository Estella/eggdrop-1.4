<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>BANS,
BAN EXEMPTIONS &amp; INVITES AND HOW THEY WORK</font></font></font></b>
<hr>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>I assume that you
know how bans work on IRC. Eggdrop handles bans and the 2 new modes, exemptions
and invite in various ways, and this chapter is intended to help clarify
how these modes are treated within the bot</font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>Ban
Exemption modes</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>This
type of mode enables the person specified in the host mask to join the
channel even if there is a ban in place matching their hostmask. Normally
this is used if a domain ie. *.net is banned, and you want to enable someone
from that domain to join i.e. *.friend.net. This list can only be viewed
by channel ops.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>Invite
modes</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>This
type of mode enables the person specified in the hostmask to join a invite
only channel without an invite.</font></font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>From here on 'mode'
applies to all three modes (ban,exemption and invite) unless otherwise
specified. There are three types of modes, and two types of attribute that
can be placed on a 'mode':</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Types of 'mode':</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>global modes</font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>These modes will be active
on every channel the bot monitors. Some will "expire" after a while (be
removed automatically). Others are considered "permanent" and can only
be removed by a master.</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>channel-specific modes</font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>These modes are active
only on one channel, and are almost always temporary modes that expire
after an hour or so (depending on how long you've specified in the config
file). Usually they're created by a Tcl script of some sort.</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>non-bot modes</font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>These are modes that were
not placed by the bot, and that the bot doesn't care about. They can be
removed by anyone on the channel. The other two types of modes are generally
protected by the bot, and have to be removed via the bot.</font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Attributes:</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>unsticky modes</font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>These modes are the style
that eggdrop sets by default, when a user uses one of the commands that
results in a mode. This attribute means that the ban will be removed if
using dynamic modes after a certain time. If a mode is <i>"sticky"</i>
and you wish to set it to be unsticky, use the <i>".unstick"</i> command.</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>sticky modes</font></font></li>

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>These modes are usually
set by a user using the <i>".stick"</i> command, modes with this attribute
are attempted to be kept active on the channel by the bot, even if the
channel is set to use dynamic modes. Obviously, if the channel isn't set
to use dynamic modes, this won't have any effect.</font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Behaviour</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The diffierent
type of mode behave differently depending on the channel settings</font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Bans</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If the channel
is supporting dynamic bans then the ban is set when the user joins the
channel otherwise the modes are permanently set. On a channel with dynamic
bans the ban expires after ban-time minutes which is specified in the config
file.</font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Exemptions</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If the channel
is not supporting dynamic exempts then they are set the entire time. Otherwise
the exemption is set when a ban is placed whose host includes that covered
by the exemption. The exemption will remain in place for at least exempt-time
minutes (defined in config file) or until after the corresponding ban has
been removed, whichever is the longer.</font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Invites</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If the channelis
not supporting dynamic invites then they are set permenantly. Otherwise
the invite is set when the channel is +i and a user requests an invite
onto the channel. The invite then remains set for invite-time minutes (defined
in config file) or until the channel goes -i again, whichever is the longer.</font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The party-line command
<i>".+&lt;ban/exempt/invite>"</i> can add a global ban or channel specific
ban depending on the parameters that are passed to it. <i>".kickban"</i>
will add a channel-specific ban.
<i>".&lt;ban/exempt/invite>s"</i> will
list them all, according to their category. Be sure to check out the help
pages for those commands for more info.</font></font></blockquote>
