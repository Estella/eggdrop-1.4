RECORDS</font></font></font></b>
<hr>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>People on irc are
recognized by the bot according to their user@host. That is, if I am on
irc as:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>*** [Kirk] is
ikaney@uk.defiant.org (Fortune favours the bold.)</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>then eggdrop will identify
me according to "ikaney@uk.defiant.org" and not by my nickname. I can change
nicknames at will and it won't forget me.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>For convenience, it's useful
to have a "handle" which always identifies the same person. Usually the
"handle" is just whatever nickname some- one was using when the bot first
learned them. The nickname you had when you first said "hello" to eggdrop
is the handle it will know you by, regardless of whatever nickname you
may be using at a given time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Because of this, only one
person can have a given handle on your bot. Masters can change it, and
anyone with party-line access can change their own handle, but it's intended
to be something stable -- unlike nicknames on irc which are about as stable
as jello.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Eggdrop likes to store a
lot of information about each user. The most important thing stored is
the list of hostmasks that a user is recognized by. You can add a new hostmask
with the /msg "ident" command. Masters can add and remove hostmasks with
the party-line commands ".adduser", ".+host", and ".-host".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Other things that are stored
include the user's flags (see <b>"Access Levels? No, Flags"</b> section),
the last time he/she was on a channel, an optional comment, their current
directory in the file area, an info line which can be displayed when they
join a channel, and possibly even some other things that Tcl scripts store.</font></font></blockquote>
