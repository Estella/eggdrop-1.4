MESSAGES THAT GET LOGGED</font></font></font></b>
<hr>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Shown below are
some messages that eggdrop might log from time to time that are a bit strange
and don't make it really that obvious what it's harping on about:</font></font>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(!) timer drift
-- spun N minutes</font></font></b></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is caused by one of several
known things..</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Your bot was swapped out of
memory for a while, or that for some reason the computer stopped letting
the bot run. Once a minute, eggdrop does a few maintanance things, including
counting down any Tcl timers you have going. If for some reason, several
minutes pass without eggdrop getting to do this, it logs this message to
let you know what happened. It's generally a bad thing, because it means
that the system your bot is on is very busy, and the bot can hardly keep
track of the channel very well when it gets swapped out for minutes at
a time.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>On some systems (at least Linux)
if the dns your bot is using to lookup hostnames is broken, and *very*
slow in responding (this can occur if the dns's uplink doesnt exist) then
you will get 4/5 minute time drifts continuously, not much can be done
about this, it's an operating system problem :(</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The clock on your machine has
just been changed (e.g. it was running behind by several minutes and was
just corrected)</font></font></li>

<blockquote><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(!) killmember(Nickname)
-> nonexistant</font></font></b></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>We have yet to track this down.
It's a mildly bad thing, though. It means the bot just got informed by
the server that someone left the channel -- but the bot has no record of
that person ever being ON the channel.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>jwilkinson@mail.utexas.edu
had some insight into this one:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This is not an eggdrop bug,
at least not most of the time. This is a bug in all but perhaps the very
latest ircd systems. It's not uncommon during netsplits and other joins
for the server to lose track of killed or collided join notices. Also,
in some servers, it is possible to specify non-standard characters, such
as carret symbols, which get falsely interpreted as capital letters.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>When converted to lowercase,
these symbols fail to get processed, and joins are not reported, although
parts are.</font></font></blockquote>
