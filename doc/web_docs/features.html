<br>EGGDROP -- AN IRC BOT
<p>Eggdrop is the most advanced IRC robot available. It has been under
development since December 1993, and, unlike most other bots, it is still
regularly updated. Its features include:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
completely different channel user lists like having a seperate bot for
each channel.</li>

<li>
complete channel protection, customizable via config file: permanently
store a ban list with comments, etc</li>

<li>
user records saved on disk and alterable via dcc chat: each user can have
a password (encrypted), a list of valid hostmasks, a set of access flags,
etc</li>

<li>
the ability to "learn" new users (if you choose to have the bot do so)
by letting users /MSG the bot "hello" and granting them automatic access
of whatever type you specify (or even no access at all)</li>

<li>
a "party line" available through dcc chat or telnet, with multiple channels,
giving you the ability to talk to people without being affected by netsplits</li>

<li>
console mode: you can view each channel through dcc chat or telnet, selectively
looking at mode changes, joins and parts, channel talk, or any combination
of the above</li>

<li>
a file system where people can upload and download files, in an environment
that looks and acts (for the most part) like a typical unix system -- plus
the ability to mark directories as hidden / unaccessable to people without
certain user flags</li>

<li>
bot network: link two or more bots together for a party line that can stretch
not only across channels, but across irc networks (one bot on EFnet, one
bot on Undernet, etc)</li>

<li>
script language: commands and features can be added to the bot on the fly,
by means of the TCL script language, giving you the power of TOTAL customization
of your bot -- similar to ircII script</li>
</ul>

<p><br>!!! WARNING !!!
<p>Eggdrop is NOT a simple bot to use. It is an advanced bot for people
who know IRC and know what they're doing. If you don't know what DCC CHAT
is or how to use it -- if you don't know the difference between #channels
and &amp;channels -- if you don't know what a clonebot or CTCP avalanche
is -- then this bot is not for you. Choose a simpler bot like Vladbot or
Baloobot or ComBot, or find one of the many scriptbots to use.
<p>This is the 1.4.xx branch of the Eggdrop Bot.
<p>*** NOTE:
<p>This bot is NOT intended for users of very limited MEMORY or DISK shell
accounts. The development of this latest design of Eggdrop is geared towards
features and flexibility. If you have restraints on the resources allowed
to run your bot, then you should instead consider the 1.0 Eggdrop version.
<p>***
<p>This latest development of Eggdrop is now compilable in either of two
configurations:
<p>MODULE - dynamic
<p>The MODULE version of Eggdrop 1.4.xx provides for the on-the-fly loading
of extensions to the bot code without having to recompile the entire bot.
This is available on OS platforms which support dynamically linked/shared
libraries in their run-time and TCL libraries. It allows for functionality
of the bot to be loaded and unloaded at any time.
<p>The base loadable modules distributed with this Eggdrop version are:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b>assoc</b> This is the functionality of the `assoc' command for naming
party `chat' lines. It also serves as an example for writing your own modules.</li>

<li>
<b>blowfish</b> The standard Eggdrop encrypting routines for passwords
and other encrytions. This can be replaced with a user-written module to
perform their own encrypting algorithms.</li>

<li>
<b>channels</b> This allows eggdrop to have channel info stored and used
on that server that you allowed for with the server module.</li>

<li>
<b>console</b> This provides storage of console settings when you exit
the bot (or .store).</li>

<li>
<b>ctcp</b> This provides the normal ctcp replies that you'd expect.</li>

<li>
<b>filesys</b> This module performs the file-system operation for DCC file
transfers to and from the BOT over via IRC DCC commands.</li>

<li>
<b>irc</b> This controls all other irc related stuff. Not loading it is
the equivalent of the old NO_IRC setting.</li>

<li>
<b>notes</b> This provides support for storing of notes for users from
each other. Notes between currently online users is supported in the core,
this is only for storing the notes for later retrieval, direct user->user
notes are built-in.</li>

<li>
<b>seen</b> This provides seen commands via msg, on channel or via dcc,
similar to the various scripts.</li>

<li>
<b>server</b> This allows eggdrop to connect to a server, but that's about
it.</li>

<li>
<b>share</b> This provides the userfile sharing support (this requires
the channels &amp; transfer modules).</li>

<li>
<b>transfer</b> This module performs the bot-to-bot userfile sharing necessary
for sharebots. It is loaded automatically when filesys is loaded.</li>

<li>
<b>wire</b> This provides an encrypted partyline communication.</li>

<li>
<b>woobie</b> This is a example/skeletal module for writing your own module.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>MODULE - static
<p>The STATIC-MODULE version of Eggdrop 1.4.xx is pretty much the same
as the module bot, except each individual module is linked into the excutable.
You still need to 'loadmodule &lt;module>' to turn them on.
<p>See the file MODULES for more specific MODULE information.
<br>New to 1.4.xx (applies to 1.3.xx also):
<p>**** BOTNET
<p>Major protocol changes, lots less messages &amp; bytes used.
<p>You WILL get double messages if you link OLD&lt;->NEW&lt;->NEW&lt;->OLD
(or any number of NEW's between them).
<br>To prevent this, have all your new bots on 1 side of the botnet, and
all the old ones on the other (although OLD&lt;->NEW&lt;->OLD should be
ok).
<p>The order of the version and handshake messages has reversed this means
on a new botlink between an OLD &amp; a NEW, but you must .link from the
OLD or the NEW wont know the password.
<p>**** USERLIST
<p>If you want to have the option of going back to an old version SAVE
your userlist!! This is a new version userlist, and it's not backwards
compatible once written (it can still READ old userlists take note).
<p>**** FLAGS
<p>Flags have multiplied &amp; split up: normal user/channel flags still
exist and are setable by .chattr. You can also now use .chattr +o|-o #channel.
New are the "user-defined" flags which are all of A-Z for users &amp; channels.
Also, bot attributes are seperated now and are set using .botattr. Bots
have "user-defined" flags 0-9. The old 0-9 user defined flags will be converted
to A-J when you upgrade your userfile.
<p>**** SHARING
<p>*BIG CHANGE* well, big in use, small in code ;)
<p>There are now 2 sharing flags, +p = passive share, +s = aggressive share.
Your bot will only accept sharing with passively with 1 bot at a time,
although any number of aggressive shares is fine.
<p>Consider the botnet:
<p>HubBotA
<br>|-+LeafBotA
<br>`-+HubBotB
<br>|-+LeafBotB
<br>`-or `-+LeafBotC
<p>Flags would be set as such:
<p>HubBotA has:
<br>LeafBotA: +sl
<br>HubBotB : +s
<br>LeafBotC: +sl
<br>LeafBotA has:
<br>HubBotA : +ph
<br>HubBotB has:
<br>LeafBotB: +sl
<br>LeafBotC: +sl
<br>LeafBotB has:
<br>HubBotB : +ph
<br>LeafBotC has:
<br>HubBotB : +ph
<br>HubBotA : +ph
<p>how's that look? :)
<p>**** Installation
<p>make install DEST=&lt;directory>
