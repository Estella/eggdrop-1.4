<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>STARTING
OUT</font></font></font></b>
<hr>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Obviously the first
thing you want to do is compile the bot. The README file tells you what
to do and answers some frequently-asked questions about compiling. If you're
in a rush and you know what you're doing, you don't have to read this at
all -- the README file tells you how to quickly compile and start up the
bot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you've read this far,
then, I'll assume you have successfully compiled eggdrop and edited the
config file.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>First of all, eggdrop has
some command-line options -- not many, because most things should be defined
through the config file. However sometimes you may want to start up the
bot in a different mode, and the command-line options let you do that.
Basically, the command line for eggdrop is:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>% eggdrop &lt;options>
&lt;config-file></font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The options available are:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>-n Don't background. Normally
eggdrop will move itself into the background when you start it up, meaning
you'll get another shell prompt and you can do other things while the bot
is going. With -n, you won't return to the shell prompt until the bot exits
(which won't normally happen until it's killed). By default, -n will send
all log entries to the console.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>-nt Don't background, use
terminal. This is just like -n, except that instead of seeing log entries,
your console will simulate a DCC chat with the bot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>-nc Don't background, show
channel info. This is just like -n, except that instead of seeing log entries,
every 10 seconds your screen will clear and you will see the current channel
status, sort of like "top".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>-m Create userfile. If you
don't have a userfile, this will make eggdrop create one, and give master/owner
status to the first person that introduces himself or herself to it. You'll
need to do this when you first set up your bot, and never again.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>-v Show version info, then
quit.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Most people never use any
of the options except -m, and you only need to use that once.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>It's <b>STRONGLY</b> recommended
to run your bot from its own directory. That way upgrading to a new version
is somewhat painless, and you won't have any troubles from language files
and the like being in the wrong location. You can put your config file
and user file in that directory, and then when you compile a new version
of eggdrop, you just have to do:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>make install=DEST
&lt;directory></font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>and it will copy all the necessary
files.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The config file that comes
with eggdrop is called "eggdrop.conf.dist". You need to edit that file
and change almost everything. It specifies the bot's nickname, server list,
and pretty much everything else about how your bot will work. You should
also rename it from "eggdrop.conf" to something resembling your bot's name,
for convenience. I call mine "sisko" since my bot is "Sisko".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can execute the script
to start the bot. For example, I use:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>chmod u+x sisko</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>to make the "sisko" script
executable. Then I edited the first line of the script to say:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>#!./eggdrop</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>which tells the operating system
which program to run when executing this script. (Obviously, it needs to
run eggdrop.) If you're too lazy to do this, or just don't feel like it,
you can still start up your bot this way:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>eggdrop &lt;options>
&lt;config-file></font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>For example:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>eggdrop -nt
sisko</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>After you've edited your config
file and set the directories up the way you want them, start the bot with
the -m option. That will make it create a user file. As soon as you've
started up the bot, you need to go to IRC and introduce yourself to the
bot. Typically this is done by sending it the /msg "hello", although many
people change that greeting to something else (read the config file for
more info about that).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>When started with the -m
option, the first person to introduce themselves to the bot will become
the master/owner. You want to be that person. Once you are recognized as
the owner, you have full access to the commands and abilities of the bot.</font></font></blockquote>
