NOTICE</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Please read this
file carefully before trying to set up this bot. Also, make <b>SURE</b>
that you select your +n (owner) users wisely! They have 100% access to
your bot and account!<b> ONLY GIVE THIS POWER TO SOMEONE YOU TRUST COMPLETELY!!</b></font></font></blockquote>

WHAT IS EGGDROP?</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Eggdrop is an IRC
bot, written in C. If you don't know what IRC is, this is probably not
whatever you're looking for! Eggdrop, being a bot, sits on a channel and
takes protective measures: to keep the channel from being taken over (in
the few ways that anything CAN), to recognize banished users or sites and
reject them, to recognize privileged users and let them gain ops, etc.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the more unique features
of eggdrop is its "partyline", accessible via DCC chat, which allows you
to talk to other people lag-free. Consider it a multi-way DCC chat, or
a miniature IRC (complete with channels). You can link up with other bots
and expand the partyline until it actually becomes something very much
like IRC, in fact.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Eggdrop is always being
improved and adjusted because there are bugs to be fixed and features to
be added (if the users demand them, and they make actually sense). In fact,
it existed for several years as v0.7 - v0.9 before finally going 1.0. This
version of eggdrop is part of the 1.4 tree. A valiant effort has been made
to chase down and destroy bugs.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This README file contains
information about how to get eggdrop, how to quickly compile the bot, what
you may need to do when upgrading from older versions, a list of frequently
asked questions about compiling, how to set up a crontab, some boring legal
stuff, info about the mailing list (a great place to ask questions, and
a good place to report bugs also), some basics about CVS usage and some
channels where you might get help with eggdrop.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The preliminary documentation
is in "eggdrop.doc" and is intended to be read after you have eggdrop compiled
and set up.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<a NAME="item2"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>(2)
HOW TO GET EGGDROP</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Before you can
compile eggdrop, you need to have Tcl installed on your system. Most systems
should have Tcl on them by now -- you can check by trying the command "tclsh".
If it works, you will be given a "%" prompt, and you can type "exit" to
exit the program. That means Tcl is on your system. If tclsh doesn't load,
then Tcl probably isn't on your system, and you will need to ftp it. The
best ftp site is:</font></font>
<center>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><a href="ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl">ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl</a></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Tcl comes with the Slackware
distribution of Linux. HOWEVER, the one that comes on Slackware 3.0 is
goofed up and you'll have to re-install it for yourself to get it working.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Currently, the 1.4 tree
of eggdrop is developed at eggheads.org. You can get the latest version
of eggdrop from ftp.eggheads.org.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>You might try www.eggheads.org
for help and information.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<a NAME="item2a"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>(2a)
CVS USAGE</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>You might obtain
the *very latest* version of eggdrop that is still under development by
using CVS. CVS means 'Concurrent Versions System' and is a tool for developers
to always keep source code up to date. Try 'man cvs' on your shell for
more information about CVS ;-)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This intended only for users
that know a fairly bit about eggdrop. Be aware that the versions of eggdrop
that you get by CVS are still being developed, and may be buggy. The Eggheads
devteam will in *NO WAY* take any responsibility for whatever might happen
to you or your shell if you use a CVS version of eggdrop.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>To obtain eggdrop over CVS,
do as follows:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(1) log into your
shell</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(2) type 'export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot'</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(3) type 'cvs login'</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(4) press &lt;enter> when
it asks for a password.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(5) in your home dir, type
'cvs checkout eggdrop1.4'</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(6) in ~/eggdrop1.4, you
should have a copy of the latest CVS version of eggdrop.</font></font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Notes:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(1) you can 'cvs
logout', but you don't need to.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(2) you don't need to go
through this whole process every time; if you want to get a CVS version
of eggdrop at a later time, you can just 'cd ~/eggdrop1.4' and type 'cvs
update -A'.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(3) if you experience errors
when using 'export', you might be using tclsh as a shell. If so, try using
the command 'setenv' instead of 'export': 'setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot'</font></font></blockquote>

FROM A PRE-1.3/1.4 VERSION TO 1.4</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>#### BACK UP YOUR
USERFILE ####</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>We can't re-iterate this
enough, if you are upgrading, and you have even a slight possibility of
downgrading again later you will HAVE to back up your userfile, or you
will lose it. v1.3 of eggdrop radically changed alot of things.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are many major changes
between v0.9, v1.0, v1.1 and v1.3/1.4 so PAY ATTENTION to this part if
you have a v0.9, 1.0 or 1.1 bot already. If you're just starting out, you
can skip this section.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>to 1.3/1.4: * If you run
sharebots, you will need to upgrade them all at the same time because of
the new userfile format. Older bots will be able to link in, but will not
get or send a userfile. 1.2's will also tend to refuse to share with another
pre1.2. MAKE A NEW CONFIG FILE from the example, there are some radical
extras.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>from 0.9/1.0 to 1.3/1.4:
* Just redo the whole thing, absolutely everything has changed including
the userfile and config file formats.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>from 1.1/1.2 to 1.3/1.4:
* You will likely want to redo the config file, as much as changed. BACK
UP!! You will need to run 'tclsh scripts/weed/&lt;userfile> c' to convert
your userfile from v3 (1.1/1.2) to v4 (1.3/1.4)</font></font></blockquote>

FROM AN OLDER 1.3/1.4 VERSION TO A NEWER ONE</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you followed
the INSTALL file and did a 'make install' (or 'make install DEST=&lt;path>')
after 'make', this will be pretty easy. Just upload the new eggdrop1.4.xx.tar.gz
file to the home dir of your shell, gunzip and untar it, and type 'cd ~/eggdrop1.4.xx'.
Then, type './configure', 'make', then kill the bot ('.die' on the partyline,
or use 'kill' on the shell) and 'make install' to the same directory your
bot is currently in. Then, you can just restart your bot.</font></font></blockquote>

MY EGGDROP WON'T RUN; IT JUST SAYS "CAN'T FIND YOUR HOSTNAME!"</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Your machine is
set up strangely, and eggdrop can't figure out its network hostname. You
can get around this by setting an environment variable called HOSTNAME.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>In sh or ksh:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>$ HOSTNAME=myhost.domain.edu</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>$ export HOSTNAME</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>In csh or tcsh:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>% setenv HOSTNAME
myhost.domain.edu</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>It should work after that.
You may want to bug your system administrator to set up her /etc/hosts
file correctly, or add those above commands to your '.login' file (sh or
ksh: '.profile').</font></font></blockquote>

WHAT THE HECK IS TCL?</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Tcl is a scripting
language written by John Ousterhout. It's much better than most "in-built"
script languages (like the one in ircII) and is meant to be linked with
anything needing a script language. So I linked it with eggdrop. The file
"tcl-commands.doc" in the eggdrop directory contains a list of the commands
added to Tcl by eggdrop. There are also several example scripts in the
scripts/ directory, and there are gobs of scripts floating around on the
ftp sites if you like working by example (which is typically the best way).</font></font></blockquote>

<p><br><a NAME="faq4"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>4.
MY BOT DIES AND THE LAST ENTRY IN THE LOGFILE IS "RECEIVED TERMINATE SIGNAL".
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND CAN I PREVENT IT?</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>There's nothing
you can do to prevent it. It means the system administrator is killing
the eggdrop process. Most of the time, it's an automatic thing that happens
when the system is being rebooted, so it's harmless. If you have a crontab
running, the bot will get restarted when the system is back online. Occasionally
the system administrator will kill the bot manually -- for example, if
he/she doesn't want bots running on the system.</font></font></blockquote>

MY COMPILE DIES AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH "LD FATAL SIGNAL 11"!</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This happens on
Linux machines that have recently been converted to ELF by upgrading to
Slackware 3.0. Apparently Slackware 3.0 comes with a non-ELF (a.out) Tcl
library, and the compiler doesn't handle that well. (It should give you
an error; instead it barfs.) Fixing it is tricky because even if you recompile
libtcl.a, the linker will most likely find the "bad" one first, and your
work will be in vain.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Here's a fix that's been
floating around on the eggdrop list:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>1. Recompile 'libtcl.a'
for yourself, to make sure an ELF librar is created.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>2. Copy it into your eggdrop/src
directory, naming it 'libtcl2.a'.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>3. Edit the Makefile and
change the line that says '-L/usr/lib -ltcl' to '-L. -ltcl2'.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>4. Recompile eggdrop.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Also send hate-mail to the
Slackware guy telling him to stop messing up the libraries. He seemed to
assume that everyone would still want to compile old-style (a.out) binaries.</font></font></blockquote>
<a NAME="faq6"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>6.
SOMEONE ELSE SET UP A BOT I DON'T LIKE. ARE THERE ANY BACKDOORS I CAN USE
TO TAKE THEIR BOT DOWN?</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>No, there have
never been any backdoors and there never will be, so please stop asking.
Every once in a while, someone finds a way to exploit a bug in eggdrop,
but we fix these bugs as soon as we find out about them. If you want to
bring down someone else's bot, you will not have my/our help.</font></font></blockquote>
<a NAME="faq7"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>7.
WHAT ARE MODULES?</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Modules are a way
of adding extra C code from the bot, much like Tcl scripts, without requiring
the bot recompiling, see doc/MODULES for more info.</font></font></blockquote>
<a NAME="faq8"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>8.
CAN I COMPILE EGGDROP WITHOUT DYNAMIC MODULES?</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Yes, you can, if
./configure detects that your system CAN'T run modules it will setup 'make'
to link the modules in statically for you, you can also choose this option
if you can do dynamic modules by typing 'make static'. You can also try
to compile dynamic modules on a static-only system by typing 'make eggdrop'.</font></font>
<p><a NAME="faq8.1"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>8.1
DO I STILL NEED TO 'loadmodule modules' ???</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>YES,
when you compile statically, all the modules are linked into the main executable
*but* they are not enabled until you use loadmodule to enable then, hence
you get nearly the same functionality with static modules as dynamic modules.</font></font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<a NAME="faq9"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>9.
WHERE CAN I GET A PRECOMPILED EGGDROP FOR MY COMPUTER?</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>It is <b>HIGHLY</b>
recommended <b>AGAINST</b> using precompiled Eggdrops from untrusted sources.
Eggdrop has been a regular target for hacking and crashing. Distribution
of precompiled (binary) versions of Eggdrop are the easiest way of hackers
to provide you with the easiest (and most dangerous) way of gaining access
to not only your bot, but to your computer account directly. Don't advertise
your precompiled eggdrop binary sites on the eggdrop list either =P</font></font></blockquote>

SETTING UP A CRONTAB</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Eggdrop has become
more stable with time, thanks mostly to people reporting bug details and
helping find places where it crashes. However, there are still a -few-
places where things aren't perfect. Few if any things in life are.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Also, most systems go down
from time to time. These things cause your bot to disappear from IRC, and
you have to restart it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The eggdrop source file
includes a csh script called 'botchk' that will help keep the bot online.
It will make the machine check every ten minutes to make sure your bot
is still running. To use it, you have to add a line to your crontab. First,
edit 'botchk' and change the directory and command line parameters so that
it will be able to start up your bot. Then, add this line to your crontab:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *
/home/mydir/botchk</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you don't want to get
emails from cron, put this:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *
/home/mydir/botchk >/dev/null 2>&amp;1</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Naturally, you need to change
the path to the correct path for botchk. If you've never used crontab before,
here is a simple way to add that line: Create a new file called 'mycron'
and put the above line into it. Then, from your shell prompt, type % crontab
mycron That will create a new crontab entry for you, with a line that runs
botchk every ten minutes. Botchk will then restart the bot when necessary
(and send you email informing you).</font></font></blockquote>

SETTING UP A CRONTAB USING AUTOBOTCHK</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Included with your
eggdrop is an eggdrop utility called 'autobotchk'. Using autobotchk is
probably the fastest way of creating your botchk and crontabbing it with
just a few required steps.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>To crontab your bot follow
the following steps:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(1) type 'cp scripts/autobotchk
..'</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>(2) type './autobotchk
&lt;eggdrop config file>'</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This will hopefully crontab
your bot using the default setup. If you want a list of autobotchk options,
type './autobotchk'. An example with options would be:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>./autobotchk eggdrop.conf.dist
-noemail -5</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This would setup crontab
to run the botchk every 5 minutes and also to not send you e-mail saying
that it restarted your bot.</font></font></blockquote>

MAILING LIST</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are currently
a couple of mailing lists about eggdrop. eggheads@eggdheads.org is the
one relevant for posts about eggdrop 1.4 &amp; 1.5 (and bug fixes, and
suggestions, etc).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>To subscribe to the eggheads
mailing list, send email to: eggheads-request@eggheads.org In the body

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Robey is no longer developing
the eggdrop code (although he does put a word in every now and then) so
don't bother emailing him. If you have a serious problem, email the eggdrop
mailing list and it will get to the coders.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Please, before posting to
this list, see what things are like, and when you do post, read over your
post for readability, spelling, and grammar mistakes. Obviously, we're
all human (or are we?) and we all make mistakes (heck, look at this document!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Open discussion and debate
is integral to change and progress. Don't flame others over mere form (grammar
and spelling), or even substantive issues either for that matter. Please
read and follow the mailing list rules.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The eggheads@eggheads.org
maillist is not dedicated to those all too common questions we have all
seen on other lists... for example:</font></font>

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>etc..</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Bug reports, technical questions,
your thoughts or suggestions on new features being added to Eggdrop, things
that should be removed or fixed, amazing problems that even stump the guru's,
etc... are what we want to see here.</font></font></blockquote>
