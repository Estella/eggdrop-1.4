<hr>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>People starting
up an eggdrop bot for the first time are usually confused about the "botnet"
support -- i.e., the ability to link two or more bots together and have
them merge party lines, and form a sort of miniature irc.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>In order to link to other
bots, your bot needs to have a telnet port defined in the config file.
The default is usually something like 2222 or 3333, but it's wise to choose
something else, especially if a lot of other people are using the same
machine. If other eggdrop bots are running from that machine, try to pick
telnet ports at least 5-10 apart.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Sometimes you will specify
a port, like 3333, but that's not available when eggdrop starts up. On
most operating systems, it just means the port was in use recently (probably
by your bot!) and it hasn't had time to reset it yet. So eggdrop will try
3334, and maybe even 3335, until it gets one. Other bots are aware of this,
and when they try to connect, if the specified port (3333 in this example)
doesn't work, they'll try the next few before giving up. If you have one
bot on 3333, and another on 3334, they will always be bumping into each
other, and other bots will get confused. That's bad.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>When you first connect two
bots together, you need to tell each bot about the other one. To do this,
use the "+bot" command. You need to know:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>the nickname of the other bot,
like 'Lamestbot'</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>the hostname, like 'maverick.math.uic.edu'</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>the telnet port it's using,
like 2222 or 3454</font></font></li>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The format of the '+bot' command
is:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>.+bot &lt;nickname>
&lt;hostname>:&lt;port></font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This creates a "bot record"
for the bot, in your userfile. It's kind of like a user record, but a little
different. For example, Lamestbot, running from connected.com on port 3454,
would be:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>.+bot Lamestbot
connected.com:3454</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Now to connect the bots, one
of you (but not both!) needs to type:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>.link &lt;botname></font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The first time two bots connect,
they set a password for each other, so that after that, nobody can "fake"
a connection between the two. You can reset that password later with the
command:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>.chpass &lt;botname></font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The bot record is like a user
record except for two things:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you share userfiles with
another bot (see below), only user records are shared. The bot records
will stay on this bot only.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are special flags that
can be set for bots, which can't be set for users.</font></font></li>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>The special flags you can set
for bots are:</font></font>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>h (hub):</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Your bot will try about
once a minute to link to a hub bot, until it succeeds. Once it's linked
to one hub, it will no longer try to connect to others.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>a (alternate):</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If no hub bots can be linked,
your bot will try to link to one of these instead. Once one alternate bot
is linked, it won't try to connect any others -- although it will still
try to link to hub bots. If a hub bot connects later, any alternate bot
could be dropped.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>s (share):</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This means that the bot
is sharing user records aggressively.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>p (passive):</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>This means that the bot
is to share user records passively with this bot.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>l (leaf):</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>If a bot is marked as a
leaf, that means you don't want it to link any other bots behind it. In
other words, it can only be connected to the botnet in one place, and no
other bots may be connected through it.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>r (reject):</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>Any bot that has this flag
will not be permitted on the botnet at all, no matter where it connects.
This is equivalent to irc's "Q-line".</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are also 10 user-defined
flags (0-9) avaliable for use with bots only.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1><b>N.B.</b>: There's a full
explanation of these flags and how to use them in the section called <i>"Userfile
Sharing".</i></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>These flags can all be changed
by the '.botattr' command just like for users. For example:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>.botattr Valis
+sh</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are several chains of
connected bots out there. See the 'nets' file for a list of the various
botnets around. If the flags above seem confusing, don't worry. Usually
the only one you need to worry about is the +h flag. And most botnets have
a policy about what flags you should set when hooking in, and they'll tell
you what to set.</font></font></blockquote>
